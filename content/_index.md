# Who are you?

My name is Daniel Ma. I'm a human, dad, thinker, developer, singer,
tinkerer, and other things.

# Why are you so unsure?

Because I want to keep learning for my whole life. I never want to
lose my sense of wonder, and I never want to be so sure of myself that
I don't listen to new thoughts and arguments.

# Where are you?
